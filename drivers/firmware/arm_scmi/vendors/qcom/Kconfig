	  The QCOM SCMI vendor protocol provides a generic way of exposing
	  a number of Qualcomm SoC specific features (like memory bus scaling)
	  through a mixture of pre-determined algorithm strings and param_id
	  pairs hosted on the SCMI controller.

	  This driver defines/documents the message ID's used for this
	  communication and also exposes the operations used by the clients.
